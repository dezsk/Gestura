# Gestura App

This project seeks to address the communication gap that disabled individuals face due to limited public understanding of sign language. Sign language conveyed through specific gestures of the hands, head, and body, enables disabled individuals to communicate effectively. However, those unfamiliar with it often struggle to interpret these gestures, leading to frequent misunderstandings and social isolation. Our team recognizes this barrier as a significant issue, particularly in educational and social environments, where accessible communication is essential.

Our solution for this problem is a mobile application that uses computer vision to translate sign language into text in real time. The application process begins with a live video stream from the mobile camera, sent to a cloud-deployed model for gesture analysis and translation into text.

By building this project, we aim to empower individuals with hearing and speaking impairments, making meaningful, real-time communication more accessible on everyday smartphones. This tool is created to bridge the communication gap effectively and foster more inclusive interactions across various social and educational settings.
